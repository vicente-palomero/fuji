## What is fujit and why does it exist?

Fujit is an app for handling timeboxes inspired in Pomodoro technique. The main reason of this project is learning how to create a simple PWA app in Vue that could be really useful for me.

I like minimalist apps, and in the past I tried some Pomodoro apps. However, almost all of them were battery consuming. I did not know which processes were running behind the scenes, and the ads stuff is annoying when you only want to measure your performance. Then, a simple and minimalist app that could help me in my daily work is a good choice for a new project half learning, half creating.

My idea was creating a quick MVP that I could use, and here is the result. The tool is not perfect, but it is good enough for letting me save time and organize my tasks better.

## Current deploy

You can use and see fujit on https://fujit.herokuapp.com.

This project is based on Vue.js and yarn. in case that you want to deploy by yourself you can clone, set up and deploy by folling these steps:

* Clone the repo.
* Run `yarn install` for seting up the project.
* Run `yarn serve` for development compilation.
* Run `yarn build` for production compilation.

## Scope of this project

As I said above, the objective of fujit is mainly learning. Having a useful tool that I can use is another objective. The result is this tool, fully functional, I use it everyday, which let me learn a little about PWAs and the workflow of building and deploying tools.

## Technologies behind fujit

As a project with learning purposes in mind, I used Vue.js 2 for the PWA tool with Vuex as a persistence system. Also, I used Travis CI for CI/CD. Nothing else.
